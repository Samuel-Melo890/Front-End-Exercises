    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the 
    largest country in both South America and Latin America. At 8.5 million square kilometers 
    (3,300,000 sq mi) and with over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country
    by area and the sixth most populous. Its capital is Brasília, and its most populous city is São 
    Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is 
    the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas;
    it is also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a 
    century of mass immigration from around the world; as well as the most populous Roman 
    Catholic-majority country.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a 
    coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). It borders all other countries in South America except
    Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon basin includes a 
    vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive 
    natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes 
    Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as
    environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global 
    issues like climate change and biodiversity loss.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the 
    landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire.
    Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred 
    from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the 
    formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved 
    in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional 
    monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led 
    to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. The country 
    became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'état. An authoritarian 
    military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance 
    resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal
    republic. Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world 
    by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brazil is a regional and middle power, and is also classified 
    as an emerging power. It is considered an advanced emerging economy, having the twelfth largest 
    GDP in the world by nominal, and eighth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America. As an 
    upper-middle income economy by the World Bank and a newly industrialized country, Brazil has the
    largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets,
    being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years. However, the country maintains noticeable
    amounts of corruption, crime and social inequality. Brazil is a founding member of the United
    Nations, the G20, BRICS, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of 
    Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.</p>
